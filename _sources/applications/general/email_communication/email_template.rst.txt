Email Templates
===============

We all know writing good emails is vital to get a high response rate, but you do not want to
rewrite the same structure every time, do you? That is where email templates come in.
Without the need to rewrite the entire email structure every time, you save time to focus on
the content. Multiple templates also let you deliver the right message to the right audience,
improving their overall experience with the company.

Enable it and understand a few concepts
=======================================

The :ref:`Developer mode <developer-mode>` must be activated). Then, go to
:menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> Templates`. A view of the existing templates is shown.

.. danger::
   It is highly recommended not to change the content in existing templates unless the user has
   prior knowledge about placeholders.

To add a new one, click on *Create* and choose the type of document this template is used with. In
the example below, the template would be sent to job applicants.

| Under *Email Configuration*, fields such as *From*, *To (Emails)*, *To (Partners)*, require
  placeholders. If the *From* field is not set, the default value is the author’s email alias, if
  configured, or email address.
| Under *Advanced Settings*, if an *Outgoing Mail Server* is not set, the one with the highest
  priority is used.
| The option *Auto Delete* permanently deletes the emails after they are sent, saving space in your
  database.

Writing content including placeholder expressions
-------------------------------------------------

A placeholder is a string of characters that temporarily takes the place of the final data. With 
email templates, for example, placeholders let you put dynamic content in order to personalize 
the email for the recipient.

A common use is to use it to indicate the name of the recipient in the newsletter so that each 
recipient gets a personalized newsletter.

Placeholders and more specifically fields that are available for a template will depend on the 
template you modify. One way to see the fields that are available is to check the Dynamic 
Placeholder Generator tab.

.. _email_communication/dynamic_placeholder_generator:

#. Under the tab *Dynamic Placeholder Generator*, look for the *Field* you would like to use.

   .. image:: email_template/placeholders.png
      :alt: View of the dynamic placeholder generator tab under a new template in Odoo

#. Next, copy the *Placeholder Expression* and paste it in the *Body* of the email, under the *Content*
   tab, using - essentially - the *Code View*.

   .. image:: email_template/codeview.png
      :alt: View of the body code view under the content tab in Odoo

#. Deactivate the *Code View* option by simply clicking on it again, and easily design the message.
   Click on *Preview* to check how the email looks before sending it.

Using functions with placeholders 
---------------------------------

Functions can be used along with your placeholders in order to format the data as you'd like within
your mail templates, for example, the time format can be changed using a function such 
as ``format_time``.

In order to use functions, you have to know the available fields to format. To know that, you have
to check the fields (the properties) of the object that are available to be used.

Checking the fields (properties) available on the object 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check the **fields available**, click on the link next to Applies to. For the example we use 
the Portal: new user template, so we click on Portal user Config.

.. image:: email_template/apply-to-model.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Template is capable of using the field of the defined Models.

By clicking on the link, you are redirected to the model, in this case the ``Portal user Config`` 
model that lists all the fields that you can use within your mail template.

.. image:: email_template/fields-of-model.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Existing fields of a model

As a side note, you can also see the fields that are available by accessing the dynamic placeholder
generator, as described :ref:`previously <email_communication/dynamic_placeholder_generator>`.

See below an example with the email field that was added in the template and its result as well as 
some other placeholders already present by default.

   :alt: Adding a field on a template and see the result

Using fields with functions 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you know the *fields* that can be used, you can use one of them with a function. For this 
example, we add the creation date, *create_date* field to the body of the template ‘Portal: new user’ 
along with the ``format_date`` function so that the user knows when he was invited.

.. image:: email_template/format-date-functions-example.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Example of the format_date on a create_date field

As you can see we use the placeholder `${}` with the ``format_date`` function which uses as a 
parameter the field create_date available on the current object, this gives the following line 
of code ``${format_date(object.create_date)}``.

.. warning::
  It's really important to check that the preview is working, if it's broken your template 
  might appear totally blank when previewing it. We also recommend not changing the content 
  in existing templates unless you have prior knowledge. We highly recommend duplicating the 
  template and apply your changes within this one.

Find below the result of the e-mail received in the recipient's mailbox with the modifications 
applied.

.. image:: email_template/rendering-format-date-function.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Rendering of the format_date function on a create_date field

Still by using the ``format_date`` function, you have the possibility to adapt the format of the 
date just in a specific email by specifying the formatting of the date as a second parameter. 
If not specified, the format used by default is the one defined in the settings of the language. 
More information on how to access these parameters can be found :ref:`here <email_communication/usable_functions>`.

In order to adapt the date format, the piece of code used in the above example 
``${format_date(object.create_date)}`` becomes ``${format_date(object.create_date, date_format='dd -- MM -- YYYY')}`` 
here dd is the day, MM the month and YYYY the year.

Here is the result once the function is adapted in the template.

.. _email_communication/usable_functions:

Functions used by default within email templates
************************************************

To format your data, many functions can be used, here are some examples.

.. note::
   **This list of functions is not exhaustive**, meaning that all functions that are available 
   aren't listed in the below list, for more functions, we invite you to check the `babel <http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/api/dates.html>`_ 
   documentation, last but not least, modifications on the templates are considered as 
   customization and isn’t covered by our support.

For the following examples, we will introduce mostly some date functions. By default, the format
of the date used is the one defined in the settings of the language.

These settings can only be accessed when the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>` is enabled. 
Once developer is enabled go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Translations --> Languages` and click
on one of the languages to see all the settings such as the time format or date format used by 
the language.

- **format_date()** - formats the date (without the time).

  Can be found on the template `Purchase Order: Send PO`:
 
  .. image:: email_template/po-template-format-date.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Code of the format_date on existing template Purchase 

  The result will look like this: 

  .. image:: email_template/po-template-format-date-rendering.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Rendering of the format_date on existing template Purchase 

- **format_datetime()** - formats the datetime, defining a specific timezone, in this case Central
  European Time (CET).

  Can be found on the template `Event: Registration`.

  .. image:: email_template/event-reg-template-format-datetime.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Code of the format_datetime on existing template Event 

  The result will look like this: 

  .. image:: email_template/event-reg-template-format-datetime-rendering.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Rendering of the format_datetime on existing template Event 

- **format_time()** - Similar to the format_datetime function except It's used only for the time, 
  not a date.

- **format_amount()** - Formats a number, an amount to display the currency depending on the display 
  setting that has been defined on the currency (the :ref:`debug mode <developer-mode>` must be 
  activated to see this feature) :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Currencies` 
  (before or after the amount depending on the convention).

Defining a default reply to on your mail template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although the field *reply to* is available within the mail templates, **this field is only used 
for mass mailing** mode (this means when sending templates on what we call bulk emailing). You 
can send emails in bulk in almost every app that has a list view. Select the records you want 
and click on the action button. If you have an option to send an email, you will see a mail 
composer with possible values to define:

.. image:: email_template/composer-mass-mailing-quotations.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Composer in mass mailing mode after selecting multiple quotations.

You can also define them by default on the template:

.. image:: email_template/reply-to-template-sales.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Reply-to field on template.

Because of this, setting a value in this field is useless as the value defined will be totally 
ignored. The default *reply-to* value is the default catchall email address to ensure a 
communication between your customer and your Odoo database. For more information about the way
the catchall works, please check :ref:`how to manage inbound messages <email_communication/inbound_messages>`.

Transactional emails and corresponding URL for each company 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using Odoo, multiple events trigger the sending of automated emails. These emails are known
as transactional emails and sometimes contain links pointing to your Odoo database.

By default, links generated by the database use the dynamic web.base.url key defined in the system
parameters. More information about this :ref:`parameter <domain-name/web-base-url>`.

If the website application isn't installed, the web.base.url key will always be the default 
parameter used to generate all the links.

It’s important to know that this key can only have a single value, meaning that in a 
multi-website/company database environment, even if you have a specific domain name for each 
website, the links generated to share a document or within a transactional email might remain the
same, whatever the website/company related to the sending of the email/document.

This is not always the case as some Odoo applications have a link established in the database with 
the website application, meaning that in this case, if a specific domain is defined for the 
websites, the URL generated in the email template will use the domain defined on the corresponding
website of the company.

.. caution::
   A document shared using the documents application will always use the web.base.url key, as the 
   document shared isn't associated with any particular website. Meaning that the URL will always be 
   the same (the web.base.url key value), whatever the company it's shared from, this is a known 
   limitation!

On the other hand, sales orders made by a customer on one of your Odoo e-commerce websites have a 
link established with the website from which the order was made. As a result, the e-mail sent for 
the sales orders uses the domain name defined for the corresponding website to generate the links.

For more information about how to configure your domains, we invite you to check :doc:`our domain name 
documentation </administration/maintain/domain_names>`.

Updating translations within email templates
********************************************

Email templates are automatically translated. Changing the translations shouldn’t be necessary. 
However, if for a specific reason you’d like to change some of the translations, this can be done.

Like any modification in the code, keep in mind that modifications that aren’t done correctly (for
example modifications leading to bad syntax) can break the template, as a result, the template
will appear blank.

In order to edit your translations, follow these steps from the template.

#. Click on the edit button, then on the language button

   .. image:: email_template/edit-language-template.png
      :align: left
      :alt: Edit the language of a template

#. A pop-up window with the different languages installed on the database will be displayed. From 
   here, editing the translations will be possible. Don't forget to hit the save button to preserve
   your changes.
