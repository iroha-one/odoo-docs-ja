Digest emails
=============

*Digest Emails* are periodic snapshots sent via email to users in an organization that include
high-level information about how the business is performing.

To start sending digest emails, begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Settings app --> Statistics
section`, activate the :guilabel:`Digest Emails` feature, and click :guilabel:`Save`.

A variety of settings can be configured for digest emails, such as:

- Deciding which :abbr:`KPIs (key performance indicators)` are shared in the digest emails
- Determining how often digest emails are sent
- Choosing who in the organization receives digest emails
- Creating custom digest email templates
- Adding additional :abbr:`KPIs (key performance indicators)` (*Studio* app required)

.. note::
   By default, the :guilabel:`Digest Email` feature is enabled. :guilabel:`Your Odoo Periodic
   Digest` serves as the primary template, which includes all :abbr:`KPI (key performance
   indicator)` measurements across the Odoo database, and is sent daily to administrators.

.. warning::
   When creating duplicates of databases that have sending capabilities (not testing-mode), the
   digest emails continue to send from the duplicate database, unless deactivated.

   To deactivate the digest email, navigate to :menuselection:`Settings --> Statistics section`.
   Then, deactivate the :guilabel:`Digest Emails` feature, by un-ticking the checkbox, and clicking
   :guilabel:`Save`. See the section on :ref:`digest-emails/deactivate`.

Customize default digest email
==============================

To customize the default digest email (*Your Odoo Periodic Digest*), go to :menuselection:`Settings

  :guilabel:`Weekly`, :guilabel:`Monthly`, or :guilabel:`Quarterly`).
- :guilabel:`Next Send Date`: the date on which the digest email will be sent again.
- :guilabel:`KPIs` tab: check/uncheck each calculated :abbr:`KPI (key performance indicator)` that
  appears in digest emails. A ticked box indicates an active :abbr:`KPI (key performance indicator)`
  in the digest email. See the section on :ref:`digest-emails/kpis`.
- :guilabel:`Recipients` tab: add/remove users who receive the digest emails. See the section on
  :ref:`digest-emails/recipients`.

   The :abbr:`KPIs (key performance indicators)` can be customized using Odoo *Studio*. Additional
   costs to the database subscription are incurred should *Studio* need to be installed. See this

After clicking :guilabel:`Save`, the new custom digest email is available as a selection in the

.. _digest-emails/custom-kpi:

Custom KPIs with Odoo Studio
============================

The :abbr:`KPIs (key performance indicators)` on a digest email template form, in the
:guilabel:`KPIs` tab, can be customized using Odoo *Studio*.

.. warning::
   Additional costs to the database subscription are incurred, should Odoo *Studio* need to be
   installed.

To begin, click the :guilabel:`üõ†Ô∏è (tools)` icon in the top-right of the screen. This is the link to
the Odoo *Studio* application.

In order to create additional fields, create two fields on the digest object:

#. Create a boolean field called `kpi_myfield`, and display it in the :guilabel:`KPIs` tab.
#. Create a computed field called `kpi_myfield_value` that computes the customized :abbr:`KPI (key
   performance indicator)`.
#. Select the :abbr:`KPIs (key performance indicators)` in the :guilabel:`KPIs` tab.

.. tip::
   Here is the `source code
   <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/15.0/addons/digest/models/digest.py>`_ for the `digest.py`
   file, which guides the programmer in the coding of the computed field.

.. seealso::
   Users can also click the :guilabel:`Recipients` tab, and then the vertical three-dot
   :guilabel:`(kebab)` menu to edit this view. Either click :guilabel:`EDIT LIST VIEW` or
   :guilabel:`EDIT FORM VIEW` to modify this tab.
