.. note::
   *Activate the developer mode (with assets)* is used by developers; *Activate the developer mode
   (with tests assets)* is used by developers and testers.

Once activated, the *Deactivate the developer mode* option becomes available.

Activate through a browser extension
====================================

| Go to the settings and extensions of your web browser, and search for *Odoo Debug*. Once the
  extension is installed, a new icon will be shown on your toolbar.
| For the *Odoo Debug* extension, a single click enables a normal version of the mode, while a
  double click enables it with assets. To deactivate it, use a single click.

the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+k`, then type `debug`: a command will show up to
activate the debug mode.
