Reporting
=========

The *Reporting* section of the *Payroll* app offers a variety of reports to choose from, organized
by location.

The *Payroll* report, *Work Entry Analysis* report, and *Salary Attachment Report* are default
reports in the *Payroll* app, and are available for all companies, regardless of location.

Beneath the three default reports are all localization-based reports, organized by country, in
alphabetical order. These reports contain all the various information for the offered benefits and
local tax laws.

To view all the available reports for the database, including all the localization-specific ones,
navigate to :menuselection:`Payroll app --> Reporting` to view the available reports in a drop-down
menu. Click on a specific report to view it.

stating: :guilabel:`You must be logged in to a (country) company to use this feature`, where
"(country)" is the specific country the company is configured for.

Line chart
~~~~~~~~~~

A line chart is the default view for the *Payroll* report. If a different view is selected, click
the :guilabel:`Line Chart` button (represented by a :guilabel:`üìà (chart increasing)` icon) in the
menu bar to change the view back to a line chart.

Several options are available for the line chart. Click the corresponding button to activate the
selection, and change the way the data is presented. These icons appear at the end of the chart
options. The various options are:

.. _payroll/stacked:

- :guilabel:`Stacked`: data is presented with each metric in its own line, "stacked" on top of each
  other. This helps visualize the distribution and variances between different categories.

.. _payroll/cumulative:

- :guilabel:`Cumulative`: data is presented with each metric on an individual line, with the total
  amount calculated by combining all the lines. This provides a comprehensive view of the cumulative
  data.

.. _payroll/descending:

- :guilabel:`Descending`: data is shown with the largest values on the left side of the chart,
  gradually decreasing towards the smallest values on the right side, along the x-axis. This
  arrangement helps emphasize trends or outliers at the extremes.

.. _payroll/ascending:

- :guilabel:`Ascending`: data is presented with the smallest values on the left side of the chart,
  increasing towards the largest values on the right side, along the x-axis. This arrangement can be
  useful for highlighting progressive growth or trends.

.. note::
   These options can be combined to create a variety of views.

Filters
=======

At the top of each report, the default filters are shown inside the :guilabel:`Search...` box.

Click the :guilabel:`‚¨áÔ∏è (down arrow)` icon in the search bar to display the available
:guilabel:`Filters`. Filters show information that match the specific filter parameters.

.. example::
   The :guilabel:`Work Entries Analysis` report has two default filters, the `Current month:(Month)
   (Year)` filter, and the `Validated` filter.

   .. image:: reporting/custom-filter.png
      :align: center
      :alt: Filters enabled for the Work Entries Analysis report.

   The :guilabel:`Payroll` report has only one default filter, the `Last 365 Days Payslip` filter.

   The :guilabel:`Salary Attachment Report` has only one default filter, the `Payslip End Date:
   (Year)` filter.

All reports can include custom filters, or group information, by different metrics (employee,
department, company, etc.).

Some reports have the option to compare the current report to the previous time period or year (a
:guilabel:`Comparison` option).

Click on a parameter to select it and activate it. The report is immediately updated with the new
parameters.

The updated report can be set as a *favorite* report, meaning the parameters are stored for quick
access in the future. To do that, click :guilabel:`Save the current search`, under the
:guilabel:`Favorites` section, located in the search bar drop-down mega menu of filter options.
Doing so reveals two options and a :guilabel:`Save` button.

To set the current report as the default configuration when the report is accessed, check the box
next to :guilabel:`Default filter`. If the current report should be accessible to everyone in the
database, check the box next to :guilabel:`Share`.

Finally, click :guilabel:`Save`, which saves the currently configured report. Then, it appears
beneath the :guilabel:`Favorites` in the search bar drop-down mega menu of filter options.
