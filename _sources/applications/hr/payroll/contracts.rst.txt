Contracts
=========

Every employee in Odoo is required to have a contract in order to be paid. A contract outlines the
terms of an employee's position, their compensation, their working hours, and any other details
about their position.

.. important::
   Contract documents (PDFs) are uploaded and organized using the *Documents* application, and are
   signed using the *Sign* application. Ensure these applications are installed in order to send and
   sign contracts. Please refer to the :doc:`/applications/finance/documents` and
   :doc:`/applications/finance/sign` documentation.

To view the employee contracts, go to the :menuselection:`Payroll app --> Employees --> Contracts`
from the top menu. All employee contracts, and their current contract status, are displayed in a
default kanban view. The default view displays both running contracts and contracts that need
action. Expired and canceled contracts are hidden in the default view.

.. note::
   The list of contracts in the *Payroll* application matches the list of contracts in the
   *Employees* application. The default contracts view in the *Payroll* application displays running
   contracts and contracts needing attention, while the default contracts view in the *Employees*
   application displays all contracts in a kanban view, organized by their stage, regardless of
   status. All contracts can be viewed by changing the filters.
