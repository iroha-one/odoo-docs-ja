     :alt: Add the work information to the Work Information tab.

.. tip::
   The users that appear in the drop-down menu for the :guilabel:`Approvers` section must have
   *Administrator* rights set for the corresponding human resources role. To check who has these
   rights, go to :menuselection:`Settings app --> Users --> Manage Users`. Click on an employee, and
   check the :guilabel:`Human Resources` section of the :guilabel:`Access Rights` tab.

.. note::
   :guilabel:`Working Hours` are related to a company's working times, and an employee cannot have
   working hours that are outside of a company's working times.

   Each individual working time is company-specific, so for multi-company databases, each company
   needs to have its own working hours set.

   If an employee's working hours are not configured as a working time for the company, new working
   times can be added, or existing working times can be modified. To add or modify a working time,
   go to the :menuselection:`Payroll app --> Configuration --> Working Times`, and add a new working
   time or edit an existing one.

   After the new working time is created, set the working hours for the employee.
