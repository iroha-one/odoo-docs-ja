Dashboard
=========

Upon opening the *Surveys* application, Odoo presents the main dashboard of the *Surveys*
application, otherwise known as the :guilabel:`Surveys` page.

.. image:: surveys/surveys-dashboard.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The Odoo Surveys application dashboard in the default Kanban view.

.. tip::
   The *Surveys* dashboard can be accessed at any time throughout the application by clicking
   :menuselection:`Surveys` from the header menu.

In the upper-left corner, there is a :guilabel:`New` button. When clicked, Odoo presents a blank
survey form that can be used to create a survey.

On the dashboard, all the surveys that have been created in the database are displayed in a default
Kanban view.

From left-to-right, after the survey name, the user who is responsible for it, and the month it was
created, each line on the *Surveys* dashboard shows the following:

- Number of :guilabel:`Questions` in that particular survey
- :guilabel:`Average Duration` of the survey (how long it typically takes a participant to complete)
- Number of :guilabel:`Registered` participants for the survey
- Number of times that particular survey has been :guilabel:`Completed`
- Percentage and data bar showcasing how many people have :guilabel:`Passed` or become
  :guilabel:`Certified`

  .. note::
     The :guilabel:`Passed` percentage and bar **only** appears when a *Required Score* has been
     configured for that particular survey.

     The :guilabel:`Certified` percentage and bar **only** appears if that particular survey has the
     *Is a Certification* option enabled on the survey form.

     If neither :guilabel:`Passed` nor :guilabel:`Certified` appear on the line, that indicates the
     survey is without a *Required Score* and was not enabled with the *Is a Certification* option.

- Number of :guilabel:`Courses` related to that survey, which **only** appears if more than one
  course has been created and attached to a single survey

.. note::
   A half-trophy background image behind the survey name indicates that the survey is a
   *Certification*.

To the far-right of those data points on the survey lines, located on the *Surveys* application
dashboard, are a collection of buttons.

Those buttons are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Share`: click to reveal a :guilabel:`Share a Survey` pop-up form that can be used to
  invite potential participants to the survey - complete with a :guilabel:`Survey Link` that can be
  copied and sent to potential participants, and a :guilabel:`Send by Email` toggle switch.

  When the :guilabel:`Send by Email` toggle is active (green switch), additional fields appear, in
  which :guilabel:`Recipients`, :guilabel:`Additional Emails`, and a :guilabel:`Subject` can be
  added to the email.

  Below that, a dynamic email template, complete with a :guilabel:`Start Certification` button
  appears, which can be modified, as well, if needed.

  :guilabel:`Attachments` can be added to the email, as well as an :guilabel:`Answer deadline` can
  be set, if needed.

  Once modifications are complete, click :guilabel:`Send` to send that email invite to all the email
  addresses/contacts listed in the :guilabel:`Recipients` field.

  .. image:: surveys/share-survey-popup-email-toggle.png

  .. tip::
     The default :guilabel:`Mail Template` for survey invites can be edited by navigating to
     :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> Email Templates` and searching for `Survey: Invite`.

  .. note::
     The :guilabel:`Send by Email` toggle switch is **not** present when the survey line has zero
     questions.

     The :guilabel:`Survey Link` only appears when the survey's *Access Mode* is set to *Anyone with
     the link*.

     The :guilabel:`Additional Emails` field only appears when the survey's *Require Login* field is
     **not** active.

- :guilabel:`Test`: click to take a test version of the survey in a new tab, from the point-of-view
  of a survey participant, in order to check for any errors or inconsistencies.
- :guilabel:`See results`: click to reveal a new tab showcasing detailed metrics and graphical
  representations of all survey participants, questions, and responses for deeper analysis.
- :guilabel:`Start Live Session`: click to initiate a *Live session* survey, and reveal a session
  manager window in a new tab. This button is **not** present for surveys that have enabled the *Is
  a Certification* option on the survey form.
- :guilabel:`End Live Session`: click to end a *Live session* survey that has been officially
  started. This button option **only** appears on survey lines that have previously initiated a live
  session.

Above the buttons that are located to the far-right of the survey lines, a :guilabel:`â‹® (three
dots)` icon appears when the cursor hovers over that particular line. When the :guilabel:`â‹® (three
dots)` icon is clicked, a drop-down menu with some configuration-related options appear:

The options are:

- :guilabel:`Edit Survey`: when clicked, Odoo reveals the survey form for that particular survey,
  which can then be modified in a number of different ways.
- :guilabel:`Share`: when clicked, Odoo reveals the :guilabel:`Share a Survey` pop-up form that can
  be used to invite potential participants to the survey.
- :guilabel:`Delete`: when clicked, Odoo presents a pop-up window, wherein the user **must** confirm
  they want to delete the survey entirely, which they can do by clicking the :guilabel:`Delete`
  button at the bottom of the pop-up window.
- :guilabel:`Color`: users can opt to choose a color to add to the survey line on the dashboard for
  added organizational purposes, if needed.

Beneath the buttons that are located to the far-right of the survey lines, there is an *Activities*
button, represented by a :guilabel:`ðŸ•˜ (clock)` icon. When clicked, a mini pop-up window appears,
from which activities related to that particular survey can be scheduled and customized.

List view
---------

The *Surveys* dashboard is shown in the Kanban view, by default, but there is also a list view
option available in the upper-right corner, represented by a :guilabel:`â‰£ (bars)` icon.

When the :guilabel:`â‰£ (bars)` icon is clicked, the survey related data is displayed in a list view.

.. image:: surveys/list-view.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The list view option located on the Odoo Surveys application dashboard.

The columns shown on the *Surveys* app dashboard, while in list view, are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Survey Title`
- :guilabel:`Responsible`
- :guilabel:`Average Duration`
- :guilabel:`Registered`
- :guilabel:`Success Ratio (%)`
- :guilabel:`Avg Score (%)`

.. tip::
   Additional columns can be added to the *Surveys* application dashboard, while in list view, by
   clicking the *additional options* drop-down menu, located to the far-right of the column titles,
   represented by a :guilabel:`(slider with two dots)` icon.

Activities view
---------------

To have the *Surveys* application dashboard display nothing but the activities associated to the
surveys in the database, click the :guilabel:`ðŸ•˜ (clock)` icon to the far-right of the other view
options, located in the upper-right corner.

.. image:: surveys/activities-view.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The activities view option located on the Odoo Surveys dashboard.

Doing so reveals a table with rows and columns. The rows show the different surveys in the database,
and the columns depict the various activity types.

.. note::
   A new survey cannot be created in this view, as it is solely for the purpose of creating and
   viewing scheduled activities.
