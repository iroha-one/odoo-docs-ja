Understanding metrics
=====================

Metrics are detailed statistics that measure the progress and success of marketing campaigns. When
creating marketing activities in a workflow, Odoo visually displays various metrics related to the
campaign with detailed graphs and in-depth data.

.. example::
   A typical line graph in a marketing automation workflow showcasing the success rate of an email.

In this case, the :guilabel:`Target` of this campaign is set to :guilabel:`Lead/Opportunity`, and
was narrowed down to *only* focus on the leads (or opportunities) whose :guilabel:`Tag Name`
contains a value of `product` — and *also* have an email address set up in the database.

Beneath the filter nodes, Odoo displays how many records in the database fall into the
previously-specified criteria filter.

.. example::
   Below, there are 18 records in the database that match the criteria.

At the top of the marketing automation campaign form, there are a series of smart buttons. The
:guilabel:`Participations` smart button in this example indicates that, out of those 18 records, 25
have become participants. In other words, they have matched the criteria, and have already
interacted with the campaign in one way or another.

.. note::
   :guilabel:`Records` represent a real-time number. Therefore, while the workflow is running,
   changes in opportunity records (deletions, additions, or adjustments) may occur.

   This means there will be real-time updates to the number of :guilabel:`Records`, but such updates
   do *not* change the number of :guilabel:`Participants`, as the metric *will not* exclude
   opportunities that have already been set as :guilabel:`Participants` before — Odoo just adds new
   ones.

   That's why the number of :guilabel:`Records` can be different from the number of
   :guilabel:`Participants` from time to time.

Whenever the system runs, updating numbers and triggering actions, it will look at the
:guilabel:`Target` model, and check if new :guilabel:`Records` have been added (or modified), which
always keeps the flow up-to-date.

.. note::
   The :guilabel:`Filter` here is applied to *all* activities. Leads that lose that specific tag
   (`product`) in the meantime will be excluded from later activities.

.. tip::
   Filters can also be applied to individual activities, in the :guilabel:`Domain` section of the
   :guilabel:`Activity` pop-up form. Use this feature to specify an individual filter that will
   *only* be performed if the records satisfy *both* filter criteria — the activity filter and its
   specific domain filter.

.. example::
   When configuring an SMS activity, make sure a certain phone number is set, in order to avoid
   triggering a SMS that would never be sent.

:guilabel:`Success` represents the number of times that the searching for participants — who match
the criteria filter(s) of that activity — was performed successfully, in relation to the total
number of participants. If a participant does *not* match the conditions, it will be added to the
:guilabel:`Rejected` number.

Hovering over the graph on an automation activity block, Odoo displays the number of successful and
rejected participants, per day, over the last 15 days.

.. note::
   Whenever a new record is added to the :guilabel:`Target` model, it's automatically added to the
   workflow, and it will start the workflow from the beginning (:guilabel:`Parent Action`).
