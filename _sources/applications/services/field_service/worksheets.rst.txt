Worksheets
==========

**Worksheets** help your field service workers perform and report their on-site tasks. They can
feature various information, such as instructions, to-do lists, etc. You can also format your
worksheet using checkboxes, bullet points, blank fields to fill in, HTML, and add files, images,
links, and more.

It is common for businesses to have their workers perform the same type of field service
repeatedly. Making custom **worksheet templates** eliminates the need to recreate the same
worksheet each time you plan a similar field service task.

Configuration
=============

To use worksheets in Field Service, go to :menuselection:`Field Service --> Configuration -->
Settings`, enable the :guilabel:`Worksheets` feature, and click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. warning::
   Worksheet templates are designed using **Studio**. Enabling the :guilabel:`Worksheets`
   feature automatically installs the **Studio** app, which may impact your price plan.

Create a worksheet template
---------------------------

To create your **worksheet templates**, go to :menuselection:`Field Service --> Configuration -->
Worksheet Templates`. Click :guilabel:`New` and give your worksheet template a name. Manually save,
then click :guilabel:`Design Template` to open **Studio** and customize your worksheet template.

In Studio, drag and drop the desired fields from the left column into your worksheet on the right.
To rearrange the fields on the worksheet, drag and drop them in the desired order. Click a field to
customize its :ref:`properties <studio/fields/properties>`.

When your worksheet template is complete, click :guilabel:`Close` in the top right corner of the
page to leave **Studio**.

Add a worksheet template to a field service task
================================================

Go to your field service task, select a :guilabel:`Worksheet Template`, and click :guilabel:`Save`.

By default, the :guilabel:`Default Worksheet` template is selected. To define another default
worksheet template, click the :guilabel:`âž”` (:guilabel:`Internal link`) icon that appears when you
hover your mouse over the :guilabel:`Project` field on the task form.

Then, in the :guilabel:`Settings` tab,  scroll down to the :guilabel:`Field service` section and
select the :guilabel:`Worksheet Template` you want to set up as default.

Use worksheets on site
======================

To complete the worksheet on site, access the task and click the :guilabel:`Worksheet` smart button.

.. note::
   - As soon as you save a worksheet, the label of the :guilabel:`Worksheet` smart button on
     the task changes to :guilabel:`Worksheet Complete` instead, even if some fields are
     left blank.
   - Any field defined as :guilabel:`Required` has to be filled for a worksheet to be saved.
