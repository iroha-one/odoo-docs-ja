Planning an itinerary
=====================

By default, **Odoo Field Service** shows a static map where all task locations for the day are
pinned. To make it more useful for the field service workers, it is possible to display an itinerary
on the map using MapBox. To do so, enable the **Map Routes** feature as follows:

#. Create or sign in to a MapBox account using the following link: `<https://www.mapbox.com/>`_.
#. `Create a token <https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/access-tokens/#adding-url-restrictions-to-access-tokens>`_.
#. Go to the `Access tokens page on Mapbox <https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/>`_ and copy
   your token.
#. In Odoo, go to the :guilabel:`Settings` app and scroll down to the :guilabel:`Integrations`
   section. Paste your Mapbox access token in the :guilabel:`Token` field under
   :guilabel:`Map Routes`, and click :guilabel:`Save`.

Displaying your itinerary on a map
==================================

.. important::
   For a field service task to be featured on the map, a **valid address** must be provided for the
   customer.

To display your tasks on a map, go to :menuselection:`Field Service --> My Tasks --> Map`. To create
your itinerary, Odoo sorts out your field service tasks based on their :guilabel:`Planned Date` to
show the way from one location to the next.

To open your itinerary on the Google Maps website or app, click :guilabel:`View in Google Maps`.
Google Maps includes your current location as a starting point for your itinerary.

.. tip::
   - By default, the map shows todayâ€™s tasks. Remove the :guilabel:`Today` filter in the search bar
     to display all tasks. Your tasks are then sorted by date in the left column.
   - Click your task in the left column or the map pin to display the task's details. From there,
     you can :guilabel:`Open` the task or click :guilabel:`Navigate to` to get an itinerary from
     your current location to this specific task's location.
