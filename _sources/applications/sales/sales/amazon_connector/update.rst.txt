Install the Amazon Selling Partner API Update
=============================================

Starting July 2022, due to a change in Amazon's API, the Amazon Connector needs to be updated to
continue to exchange information with Amazon. This also makes it easier for you to set up the
Connector.

.. note::
   If your Odoo database is created after the update was released, the update module is installed
   automatically. To check if this module is already installed, go to :guilabel:`Apps`, remove the
   ``Apps`` filter and search for ``Amazon``. If the module :guilabel:`Amazon/Selling Partner API
   Patch` is present and marked as installed, your Odoo database is already up-to-date and you can
   proceed with the :doc:`setup <setup>` step of the Amazon Connector.

Update Odoo to the latest release
=================================

The new authentication mechanism is made available through a new Odoo module; to
be able to install it, you must make sure that your Odoo source code is up-to-date.

If you use Odoo on Odoo.com or Odoo.sh platform, your code is already up-to-date and
you can proceed to the next step.

If you use Odoo with an on-premise setup or through a partner, then you must update
your installation as detailed in
:doc:`this documentation page </administration/maintain/update>`
or by contacting your integrating partner.

Update the list of available modules
====================================

New modules must be *discovered* by your Odoo instance to be available in the **Apps**
menu.

To do so, activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, and go to :menuselection:`Apps -->
Update Apps List`. A wizard will ask for confirmation.

Install the Amazon/Selling Partner API Patch
============================================

.. warning::
   You should never install new modules in your production database without first testing them in a
   duplicate or staging environment. For Odoo.com customers, a duplicate database can be created
   from the database management page. For Odoo.sh users, you should use a staging or duplicate
   database. For on-premise users, you should use a staging environment---contact your integrating
   partner for more information regarding how to test a new module in your particular setup.

The module should now be available in your :guilabel:`Apps` menu. Remove the ``Apps`` filter and
search for ``Amazon``; the module :guilabel:`Amazon/Selling Partner API Patch` should be available
for installation. If you cannot find the module after having updated the list of available modules,
it means your Odoo source code is not up-to-date; refer to step one of this page.

Once the module is installed, link your Amazon account by following the instructions on the
:doc:`setup <setup>` page.
