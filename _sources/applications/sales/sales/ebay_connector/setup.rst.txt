How to configure eBay in Odoo?
==============================

Create eBay tokens
==================

In order to create your tokens, you need to create a developer account on the
`developer portal <https://go.developer.ebay.com/>`_.
Once you are logged in, you can create **Sandbox Keys** and **Production Keys**
by clicking on the adequate buttons.

After the creation of the keys, you can get the user token. To do so, click on
the **Get a User Token** link in the bottom of the page. Go through the form,
log in with you eBay account and you will get the keys and token needed to
configure the module in Odoo.

Set up tokens in Odoo?
======================

To set up the eBay integration, go to :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Settings`.

First choose if you want to use the production or the sandbox eBay Site. Then
fill in the fields **Developer Key**, **Token**, **App Key**, **Cert Key**.
Apply the changes.

Once the page is reloaded, you need to synchronize information from eBay. Push
on **Sync countries and currencies**, then you can fill in all the other fields.

When all the fields are filled in, you can synchronize the categories and the
policies by clicking on the adequate buttons.

Accept account deletion notifications
=====================================

Since September 2021, **eBay requires supporting customer account deletion/closure notifications**.
As such, when eBay receives an account request for deletion, all eBay partners must confirm the
reception of the request and take further action if necessary.

Odoo has a notification endpoint to receive those notifications, confirm the reception of the
request, and handle the first set of actions to anonymize the account details in **Contacts** and
remove the customer's access to the portal.

.. important::
   Make sure to correctly :ref:`set up your subscription to the marketplace account deletion
   notifications <ebay/subscribe-account-deletion-notifications>` as eBay may temporarily disable
   the related eBay account until the subscription is completed.

Verify your installation of Odoo is up to date
----------------------------------------------

In order to activate the endpoint, the module **eBay Connector - Account Deletion** must be
installed. If your Odoo database was first created after September 2021, the module is installed
automatically and you can proceed to the :ref:`next step <ebay/retrieve-endpoint-details>`.

Update Odoo to the latest release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The notification endpoint is made available through a new Odoo module; to be able to install it,
you must make sure that your Odoo source code is up-to-date.

- If you use Odoo on Odoo.com or Odoo.sh platform, your code is already up-to-date and you can
  proceed to the next step.
- If you use Odoo with an on-premise setup or through a partner, then you must update your
  installation as detailed in :doc:`this documentation page </administration/maintain/update>` or by
  contacting your integrating partner.

Update the list of available modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New modules must be *discovered* by your Odoo instance to be available in the :menuselection:`Apps`
menu.

To do so, activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`, and go to :menuselection:`Apps ->
Update Apps List`. A wizard will ask for confirmation.

Install the eBay Connector - Account Deletion update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
   You should never install new modules in your production database without testing them in a
   duplicate or staging environment. For Odoo.com customers, a duplicate database can be created
   from the database management page. For Odoo.sh users, you should use a staging or duplicate
   database. For on-premise users, you should use a staging environment - you should contact your
   integrating partner for more information regarding how to test a new module in your particular
   setup.

To install the module, go to the :menuselection:`Apps` menu, remove the `Apps` search facet and
search for `ebay`. If the module **eBay Connector - Account Deletion** is present and marked as
installed, your Odoo database is already up-to-date and you can proceed with the next step. If it is
not yet installed, install it now.

.. _ebay/retrieve-endpoint-details:

Retrieve endpoint details from Odoo
-----------------------------------

The endpoint details can be found in :menuselection:`Sales --> Configuration --> Settings --> eBay`.
Click on *Generate Token* to retrieve your **Verification Token**.

.. _ebay/subscribe-account-deletion-notifications:

Subscribe to account deletion notifications
-------------------------------------------

Log in on the `developer portal of eBay <https://go.developer.ebay.com/>`_ and go to **Alerts &
Notifications**.

To subscribe to deletion/closure notifications, eBay needs a few details:

- An **email address** to send notifications to if the endpoint is unreachable.
- The **endpoint details**:

  - The URL to Odoo's account deletion notification endpoint
  - A verification token

.. tip::
   You can edit the last two fields once the email address field is filled out.

Verify the connectivity with the endpoint
-----------------------------------------

After setting the retrieved endpoint details in eBay's dashboard, consider testing the connectivity
with the **Send Test Notification** button.

You should get the following confirmation message: "A test notification was sent successfully!"

Using the updated synchronisation method
========================================

If you have a lot of products, the eBay API can sometimes refuse some synchronization
calls due to a time-based limit on the number of requests that eBay enforces.

To fix this issue, a new implementation mechanism has been developed; however this
updated mechanism is disabled by default to avoid having the 2 systems running in
parallel in existing installations.

To switch to the new synchronization mechanism:

#. Activate the :ref:`developer mode <developer-mode>`.
#. Go to :menuselection:`Settings --> Technical --> Scheduled Actions`
#. Archive the old synchronization actions (both are named *Ebay: update product status*)
#. Activate the new synchronization actions (*Ebay: get new orders* which runs every 15min by
   default and *Ebay: synchronise stock (for 'get new orders' synchronisation)* which runs once a
   day per default)
#. Ensure that the **Next Execution Date** for both these actions are in the near future

Starting with the next execution date, the new method will be used instead of the old one.
