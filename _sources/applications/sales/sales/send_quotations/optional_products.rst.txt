Optional products
=================

The use of optional products is a marketing strategy that involves the cross-selling of products
along with a core product. The aim is to offer useful and related products to customers, which may
result in an increased sale.

For instance, if a customer wants to buy a car, they have the choice to order massaging seats, as
well, or ignore the offer and simply buy the car. Presenting the choice to purchase optional
products enhances the customer experience.

Optional products on quotations
===============================

With the Odoo *Sales* application, it is possible to add or modify optional products directly on
quotations by navigating to the :guilabel:`Optional Products` tab on a quotation form.

   order.

In practice, customers are able to add different optional products to an order by clicking the
:guilabel:`ðŸ›’ (shopping cart)` icon, located to the right of the optional product line. If a
customer selects all the optional products suggested, these additional items are automatically
filled in on the quotation that is managed by the salesperson.

When the customer adds an optional product(s) to an order, the salesperson is instantly notified
about the change, along with any other change the customer makes to an order. This allows
salespeople to stay up-to-date with everything related to an order in the backend of the *Sales*
application.

Optional products on quotation templates
========================================

.. note::
   Be sure to review the documentation on how to
   :doc:`/applications/sales/sales/send_quotations/quote_template` to better understand how
   quotation templates work before reading the following information.

For quotation templates, just like a typical quotation form, there is also an :guilabel:`Optional
Products` tab, wherein related products or services can be added to a quotation template.

To add optional products to a quotation template, navigate to :menuselection:`Sales app -->
Configuration --> Quotation Templates`. Then, either select an existing quotation template to edit,
or create a new one by clicking :guilabel:`New`.

On the quotation form, click :guilabel:`Edit`, then click the :guilabel:`Optional Products` tab.
Under the :guilabel:`Optional Products` tab, click :guilabel:`Add a line`, and select the desired
product to add as an optional product to the quotation template.

.. tip::
   It's best to offer optional products that would encourage a customer to add additional items to
   their order, or entice them to purchase a more expensive version of their initially selected
   product.

   For example, if a customer purchases a wooden chair, some optional products could be: a warranty
   on that chair and/or a wooden chair with leather seats.

When the desired optional product(s) have been added, click :guilabel:`Save` to save all changes.

.. note::
   There is no limit to how many optional products can be added to a quotation template.

The products added in the :guilabel:`Optional Products` tab are present in the quotation, by
default, whenever that particular quotation template is used.
