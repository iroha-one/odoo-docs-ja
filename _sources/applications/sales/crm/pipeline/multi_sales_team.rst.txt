====================
Multiple sales teams
====================

Odoo lets you manage several sales teams, departments, or channels, each with their own unique
sales processes, using *Sales Teams*.


Create a new Sales Team
=======================

To create a new Sales Team, go to :menuselection:`CRM --> Sales --> Teams` then click
:guilabel:`Create`.

On the creation page, set an :guilabel:`Email Alias` to automatically generate a lead/opportunity
for this Sales Team every time a message is sent to that unique email address. You can also choose
whether to accept emails from :guilabel:`Everyone`, :guilabel:`Authenticated Partners`, or
:guilabel:`Followers Only`.

Set a :guilabel:`Domain` to assign leads/opportunities to this Sales Team based on specific
filters, such as country, language, or campaign. Set an :guilabel:`Invoicing Target` if this team
has specific monthly revenue goals.

Add members to a Sales Team
---------------------------

To add team members, click :guilabel:`Add` under the Assignment tab when editing the Sales Team's
configuration page. Select a salesperson from the dropdown menu or create new salesperson. Set a
maximum number of leads that can be assigned to this salesperson in a 30-day period to ensure that
they do not overwork.

One person can be added as a team member or Team Leader to multiple Sales Teams, allowing them to
access all of the pipelines that they need to.

Sales Team dashboard
====================

To view the Sales Team dashboard, go to :menuselection:`CRM --> Sales --> Teams`. Any teams you are
a part of will appear as dashboard tiles.

Each tile gives an overview of the Sales Team's open opportunities, quotations, sales orders, and
expected revenue, as well as a bar graph of new opportunities per week and an invoicing progress
bar.

Click on the three dots in the corner of a tile to open a navigational menu that lets you quickly
view documents or reports, create new quotations or opportunities, pick a color for this team, or
access its configuration page.
