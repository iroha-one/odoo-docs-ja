Getting started
===============

**Point of Sale** is a fully integrated application that allows you to sell products (online or
offline) with any device. It also automatically registers product moves in your stock, gives you
real-time statistics, and consolidations across all shops.

Configuration
=============

Make products available
-----------------------

To make products available for sale, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`,
and select a product to open the product form. In the :guilabel:`Sales` tab, enable
:guilabel:`Available in POS`.

Configure payment methods
-------------------------

To add a payment method, you first need to create it. Go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale -->
Configuration --> Payment Methods --> Create`, and set a name. Check :guilabel:`Identify Customer`
to allow this payment method *exclusively* for registered customers.

Then, select the :guilabel:`Journal`. Choose :guilabel:`Cash` to use this payment method for cash
payments, or :guilabel:`Bank` to use it for card payments.

   when created, add a link to the customeraccount page under advanced_pricing_features

.. note::
   - Selecting a :guilabel:`bank` journal automatically adds the :guilabel:`Use a Payment Terminal`
     field in which you can add your terminal's information.
   - Credentials are mandatory to use a payment terminal. To learn how to configure the different
     terminals, check out the following documentation pages:

     - :doc:`Adyen configuration <../payment/adyen>`
     - :doc:`Vantiv configuration <../payment/vantiv>`
     - :doc:`Ingenico configuration <../payment/ingenico>`
     - :doc:`Six configuration <../payment/six>`
     - :doc:`Worldline configuration <../payment/worldline>`

Once the payment method is created, you can select it in your POS settings. To do so, go to
:menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Settings`. Select a POS for which you wish to
make the payment method available in the :guilabel:`Point of Sale` field, and add the payment
method(s) under the :guilabel:`Payment` section.

POS sessions
============

.. _pos/start-session:

Start a session
---------------

From the **POS dashboard**, click :guilabel:`New Session` and at the :guilabel:`Opening Cash
Control` screen, click :guilabel:`Open Session` to start a POS session, or click :guilabel:`Continue

.. note::
   - You can filter the **orders list** by :guilabel:`Receipt Number`, :guilabel:`Date` or
     :guilabel:`Customer` using the search bar.
   - You can also refund a product by selecting the returned product from an open session, and
     setting a negative quantity that equals the number of returned products. To do so, click
     :guilabel:`Qty` and :guilabel:`+/-`, followed by the quantity of returned products.

Close the POS session
---------------------

To close your session, click :guilabel:`Close` in the upper right corner of your screen; doing so
opens the :guilabel:`Closing Control` pop-up screen. From this screen, you can retrieve various
information:

- the number of orders made and the total amount made during the session;
- the expected amounts grouped by payment method.

Before closing this window, count your cash using the calculator icon. Doing so opens a pop-up
window that computes the total amount in the cash drawer depending on the coins and bills counted
and added manually. Then, click :guilabel:`Confirm` or :guilabel:`Discard` to close the window. The
computed amount is set in the :guilabel:`Counted` column, and the :guilabel:`Money Details` are
specified in the **Notes** section.

Once you are done controlling the amounts, click :guilabel:`Close Session` to close and go back to
the **POS dashboard**.

.. note::
   - You can let the session open by clicking :guilabel:`Backend` or abort and keep selling by
     clicking :guilabel:`Discard`.
   - Depending on your setup, you might only be allowed to close a session if the expected cash
     revenue equals the counted cash. To close it anyway, click :guilabel:`Ok` at the
     :guilabel:`Payments Difference` screen.

.. tip::
   - It is strongly advised to close your POS session at the end of each day.
   - To look at all your previous sessions, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Orders -->
     Sessions`.

View statistics
===============

To access your statistics, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Reporting --> Orders`. Or, from
the **POS dashboard**, click the vertical ellipsis (:guilabel:`â‹®`) button, :guilabel:`Reporting`,
and :guilabel:`Orders`.

These statistics are available in a graph or pivot view that you can filter or group depending on
your needs.
