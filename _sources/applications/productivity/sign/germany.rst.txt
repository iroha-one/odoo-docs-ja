Legal framework for electronic signatures in Germany
====================================================

In Germany, electronic signatures are regulated under `eIDAS Regulation No. 910/2014
<https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG>`_ and
the `Trust Services Act <https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/vdg/BJNR274510017.html>`_. The law
establishes the legal basis for acknowledging electronic records, contracts, and digital signatures.
The key points of the law include:

- **Legal recognition**: electronic signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures if
  they meet certain criteria.
- **Reliability and security**: electronic signatures must be created with a secure method that can
  reliably identify the signatory and ensure the integrity of the signed document.
- **Qualified signature**: there are certain use cases that require a qualified signature issued by
  a trust service provider.
