connected, the screen can be used to display a :abbr:`PoS (Point of Sale)` order to a client.

   Access the customer display from any other computer by going to the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of
   Things)` Box homepage and clicking on the :guilabel:`POS Display` button.

Connection
==========

The way to connect the screen display to the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` Box differs depending
on the model.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: IoT Box model 4

      Connect up to two screens with Micro-HDMI cables on the side of the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of
      Things)` Box. If two screens are connected, they can display distinct content (see usage
      below).

   .. tab:: IoT Box model 3

      Connect the screen with an HDMI cable on the side of the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` Box.

.. important::
   Screen(s) should be connected before the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` Box is switched on. If
   it is already on, connect the screen(s), and then restart the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)`
   Box by unplugging it and plugging it back into its power source.

.. warning::
   The usage of HDMI/Micro-HDMI adapters may cause issues which will result in a blank, black screen
   on the screen display. Cable usage is recommended.

If the connection was successful, the screen should display the :guilabel:`POS Client display`
screen.

Things)` Box homepage.
