Cross-selling: Accessory and Optional Products
==============================================

Any sales process is an opportunity to maximize revenues. For example, with an extended warranty
or some accessories.

To do so, you can use **Cross-selling**, a sales technique consisting in selling a customer
something in addition to the product or service they were originally shopping for. It is a great way
to maximize the value of each one of your customers.

It can be done via two different features:

- :ref:`Accessory products <cross_selling/accessory>` on the checkout page.
- :ref:`Optional products <cross_selling/optional>` on a new :guilabel:`Add to Cart` screen.

Accessory Products
==================

**Accessory Products** are products that are displayed when customers review their cart before
paying. As an example, you could suggest a mouse or a keyboard when someone buys a computer.

To add *Accessory Products*, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Products --> Products` and, under
the :guilabel:`Sales Tab`, add your products to the :guilabel:`Accessory Products` field.

Now, go to your website and add the product to your cart. On the payment step, you can see your
accessory products suggested to the customer.

Optional Products
=================

**Optional products** are products directly related to an item. Each time the product is added to a
cart, a pop-up appears, suggesting other products to buy.

To enable optional products, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings` and tick
:guilabel:`Optional Products`. Then, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Products --> Products` and
open the item you want to add an optional product to. In the :guilabel:`Sales tab` of that product,
add as many optional products as you want.

From now, when a customer adds this product to their cart, a pop-up appears and suggests also adding
the optional product(s).
