.. note:: You are on the Odoo Saas Platform?

    When you `create your database on www.odoo.com/trial <https://www.odoo.com/trial>`__, we create it for you on our own server.
    You don't have anything to do.


.. note:: What about the Goal?

    Odoo push out-of-the-box some custom event: `Lead Generation` and `Shop`.
