Website analytics
=================

Website analytics helps website owners understand how people use their site. It provides data on
visitor demographics, behavior, and interactions, helping improve websites and marketing strategies.

You can track your Odoo website's traffic using :ref:`website/analytics/plausible` or
:ref:`website/analytics/GA`. We recommend using Plausible.io as it is privacy-friendly, lightweight,
and easy to use. The Plausible analytics dashboard is also integrated into Odoo and can be accessed
via :menuselection:`Website --> Reporting --> Analytics`.

Plausible.io
============

If your database is hosted on Odoo Online, the Plausible.io integration is available in Odoo for
free. To enable the feature, go to :menuselection:`Website --> Configuration --> Settings`, then, in
the :guilabel:`SEO` section, enable :guilabel:`Plausible Analytics` and click :guilabel:`Save`. You
can then access your Plausible analytics dashboard by going to :menuselection:`Website --> Reporting
--> Analytics`.

If your database is hosted on Odoo.sh or on-premise, or if you wish to use your own Plausible.io
account, proceed as follows:

#. Create or sign in to a Plausible account using the following link: `<https://plausible.io/register>`_.
#. If you are creating a new account, go through the registration and activation steps. When asked
   to provide your website details, add its :guilabel:`Domain` without including `www` (e.g.,
   `example.odoo.com`) and change the :guilabel:`Reporting Timezone` if necessary. Click
   :guilabel:`Add snippet` to proceed to the next step. Ignore the :guilabel:`Add JavaScript snippet`
   instructions and click :guilabel:`Start collecting data`.
#. Once done, click the Plausible logo in the upper-left part of the page to access your `list of
   websites <https://plausible.io/sites>`_, then click the gear icon next to the website.

#. Enter a :guilabel:`Name`, leave the :guilabel:`Password` field empty, as the Plausible analytics
   dashboard integration in Odoo doesn't support it, then click :guilabel:`Create shared link`.

   :guilabel:`Shared Link` and click :guilabel:`Save`.

.. tip::
   If you have :doc:`multiple websites <../configuration/multi_website>`, add your websites to your
   Plausible.io account by going to `<https://plausible.io/sites>`_ and clicking :guilabel:`+ Add
   website`. In Odoo, in the **Website settings**, make sure to select the website in the
   :guilabel:`Settings of Website` field before pasting the :guilabel:`Shared link`.
