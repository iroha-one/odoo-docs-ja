Instructions quality check
==========================

.. |QCP| replace:: :abbr:`QCP (Quality Control Point)`

In Odoo *Quality*, an *Instructions* check is one of the quality check types that can be selected
when creating a new quality check or quality control point (QCP). *Instructions* checks consist of a
text entry field that allows the creator to provide instructions for how to complete the check.

For a full overview of how to configure a quality check or a |QCP|, see the documentation on
:ref:`quality checks <quality/quality_management/quality-checks>` and :ref:`quality control
points <quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`.

Process an Instructions quality check
=====================================

There are multiple ways that *Instructions* quality checks can be processed. If a quality check is
assigned to a specific manufacturing, inventory, or work order, the check can be processed on the
order itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the check's page.

Process from the quality check's page
-------------------------------------

To process an *Instructions* quality check from the check's page, begin by navigating to
:menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`, and select a quality check. Follow
the :guilabel:`Instructions` for how to complete the check.

If the product passes the check, click the :guilabel:`Pass` button above the quality check form. If
the product does not pass the check, click the :guilabel:`Fail` button, instead.

Process quality check on an order
---------------------------------

To process an *Instructions* quality check on an order, select a manufacturing order or inventory
order (receipt, delivery, return, etc.) for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be
selected by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`,
and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be selected by navigating to
:menuselection:`Inventory`, clicking the :guilabel:`# To Process` button on an operation card, and
selecting an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple :guilabel:`Quality Checks` button appears
above the order. Click the button to open the :guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window, from which
any quality checks created for the order can be processed.

To complete an *Instructions* quality check, follow the instructions detailed in the
:guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window. Finally, click :guilabel:`Validate` to confirm that the
check has been completed.

If an issue or defect is found during the quality check, a quality alert may need to be created to
notify a quality team. To do so, click the :guilabel:`Quality Alert` button that appears at the top
of the manufacturing or inventory order after the check is validated.

Clicking :guilabel:`Quality Alert` opens a quality alert form on a new page. For a complete guide on
how to fill out quality alert forms, view the documentation on :ref:`quality alerts
<quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`.

Process work order quality check
--------------------------------

When configuring a |QCP| that is triggered by a manufacturing order, a specific work order can also
be specified in the :guilabel:`Work Order Operation` field on the |QCP| form. If a work order is
specified, an *Instructions* quality check is created for that specific work order, rather than the
manufacturing order as a whole.

Quality checks configured for work orders must be completed from the tablet view. To do so, begin by
navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`. Select a
manufacturing order that includes a work order for which a quality check is required. Open the
tablet view for that work order by clicking the :guilabel:`ðŸ“± (tablet)` button on the order's line.

With tablet view open, complete the steps listed on the left side of the screen until the
*Instructions* quality check step is reached. Upon reaching the check, the instructions for how to
complete it will appear at the top of the screen. Follow the instructions, then click
:guilabel:`Next` to move on to the next step.

If an issue or defect is found during the quality check, a quality alert may need to be created to
notify a quality team. To do so, click the :guilabel:`â˜° (menu)` button in the tablet view, and then
select :guilabel:`Quality Alert` from the :guilabel:`Menu` pop-up window.

Clicking :guilabel:`Quality Alert` opens a :guilabel:`Quality Alerts` pop-up window, from which a
quality alert can be created. For a complete guide to quality alert creation, view the documentation
on :ref:`quality alerts <quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`.
