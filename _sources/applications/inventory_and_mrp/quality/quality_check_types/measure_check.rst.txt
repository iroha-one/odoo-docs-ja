In Odoo *Quality*, a *Measure* check is one of the quality check types that can be selected when
creating a new quality check or quality control point (QCP). *Measure* checks prompt users to
measure a certain aspect of a product and record the measurement in Odoo. For the quality check to
pass, the recorded measurement must be within a certain *tolerance* of a *norm* value.

Create a Measure quality check
==============================

There are two distinct ways that *Measure* quality checks can be created. A single check can be
manually created. Alternatively, a |QCP| can be configured that automatically creates checks at a
predetermined interval.

This documentation only details the configuration options that are unique to *Measure* quality
checks and |QCPs|. For a full overview of all the configuration options available when creating a
single check or a |QCP|, see the documentation on :ref:`quality checks
<quality/quality_management/quality-checks>` and :ref:`quality control points
<quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`.

Quality check
-------------

To create a single *Measure* quality check, navigate to :menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control
--> Quality Checks`, and click :guilabel:`New`. Fill out the new quality check form as follows:

- In the :guilabel:`Type` drop-down field, select the :guilabel:`Measure` quality check type.
- In the :guilabel:`Team` drop-down field, select the quality team responsible for managing the
  check.
- In the :guilabel:`Instructions` text field of the :guilabel:`Notes` tab, enter instructions for
  how the picture should be taken.

Quality control point (QCP)
---------------------------

To create a |QCP| that generates *Measure* quality checks automatically, navigate to
:menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Control Points`, and click :guilabel:`New`. Fill out
the new |QCP| form as follows:

- In the :guilabel:`Type` drop-down field, select the :guilabel:`Measure` quality check type. Doing
  so causes two new fields to appear: :guilabel:`Norm` and :guilabel:`Tolerance`.

  - Use the first text-entry field of the :guilabel:`Norm` field to record the ideal measurement
    that the product should conform to. Use the second text-entry field to specify the unit of
    measurement that should be used.
  - The :guilabel:`Tolerance` field features two sub-fields: :guilabel:`from` and :guilabel:`to`.
    Use the :guilabel:`from` field to specify the minimum acceptable measurement, and the
    :guilabel:`to` field to specify the maximum acceptable measurement.

- In the :guilabel:`Team` drop-down field, select the quality team responsible for managing the
  checks created by the |QCP|.
- In the :guilabel:`Instructions` text field, enter instructions for how the measurement should be
  taken.

Process a Measure quality check
===============================

Once created, there are multiple ways that *Measure* quality checks can be processed. If a quality
check is assigned to a specific inventory, manufacturing, or work order, the check can be processed
on the order itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the check's page.

From the check's page
---------------------

To process a *Measure* quality check from the check's page, begin by navigating to
:menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`, and select a quality check. Follow
the :guilabel:`Instructions` for how to take the measurement.

After taking the measurement, record the value in the :guilabel:`Measure` field on the quality check
form. To manually pass or fail the check, click :guilabel:`Pass` or :guilabel:`Fail` at the top-left
corner of the check.

Alternatively, if the quality check is assigned to a |QCP| for which *norm* and *tolerance* values
have been specified, click :guilabel:`Measure` at the top-left corner of the check instead. Doing so
automatically marks the check as *Passed* if the recorded value is within the specified *tolerance*,
or *Failed* if the value is outside of it.

On an order
-----------

To process a *Measure* quality check on an order, select a manufacturing order or inventory order
(receipt, delivery, return, etc.), for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be
selected by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`,
and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be selected by navigating to
:menuselection:`Inventory`, clicking the :guilabel:`# To Process` button on an operation card, and
selecting an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple :guilabel:`Quality Checks` button appears
at the top of the page. Click the button to open the :guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window, which
shows all of the quality checks required for that order.

To process a *Measure* quality check, measure the product as instructed, then enter the value in the
:guilabel:`Measure` field on the pop-up window. Finally, click :guilabel:`Validate` to register the
recorded value.

If the value entered is within the range specified in the :guilabel:`Tolerance` section of the
|QCP|, the quality check passes and the pop-up window closes. The rest of the manufacturing or
inventory order can then be processed as usual.

However, if the value entered is outside of the specified range, a new pop-up window appears, titled
:guilabel:`Quality Check Failed`. The body of the pop-up shows a warning message that states,
:guilabel:`You measured # units and it should be between # units and # units.`, as well as the
instructions entered in the :guilabel:`Message If Failure` tab of the |QCP|. At the bottom of the
pop-up, two buttons appear: :guilabel:`Correct Measure` and :guilabel:`Confirm Measure`.

   :alt: The "Quality Check Failed" pop-up window.

If the measurement was not entered correctly and should be changed, select :guilabel:`Correct
Measure`. Doing so re-opens the :guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window. Enter the corrected
measurement in the :guilabel:`Measure` field, and then click :guilabel:`Validate` to complete the
check.

If the measurement was entered correctly, click :guilabel:`Confirm Measure` instead, and the quality
check fails. Follow any instructions that were listed on the :guilabel:`Quality Check Failed` pop-up
window.

If a quality alert must be created, click the :guilabel:`Quality Alert` button that appears at the
top of the manufacturing or inventory order after the check fails. Clicking :guilabel:`Quality
Alert` opens a quality alert form on a new page.

For a complete guide on how to fill out the quality alert form, view the documentation on
:ref:`quality alerts <quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`.

On a work order
---------------

When configuring a |QCP| that is triggered during manufacturing, a specific work order can also be
specified in the :guilabel:`Work Order Operation` field on the |QCP| form. If a work order is
specified, a *Measure* quality check is created for that specific work order, rather than the
manufacturing order as a whole.

*Measure* quality checks created for work orders must be processed from the tablet view. To do so,
begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`.
Select a manufacturing order that includes a work order for which a quality check is required. Open
the tablet view for that work order by selecting the :guilabel:`Work Orders` tab, and then clicking
the :guilabel:`ðŸ“± (tablet)` button on the order's line.

With tablet view open, complete the steps listed on the left side of the screen until the *Measure*
quality check step is reached. Upon reaching the check, the instructions for how to take the
measurement appear at the top of the screen. Enter the measured value in the :guilabel:`Measure`
field above the instructions, and then click :guilabel:`Validate`.

If the measurement entered is within the range specified in the :guilabel:`Tolerance` section of the
|QCP|, the quality check passes and the tablet view moves on to the next step of the work order.
However, if the measurement entered is outside of the specified range, a pop-up window appears,
titled :guilabel:`Quality Check Failed`.

The body of the :guilabel:`Quality Check Failed` pop-up window shows a warning message that states,
:guilabel:`You measured # units and it should be between # units and # units.`, as well as the
instructions entered in the :guilabel:`Message If Failure` tab of the |QCP|. At the bottom of the
pop-up, two buttons appear: :guilabel:`Correct Measure` and :guilabel:`Confirm Measure`.

.. image:: measure_check/measure-check-failed.png

   :alt: The "Quality Check Failed" pop-up window.

If the measurement was not entered correctly, and should be changed, select :guilabel:`Correct
Measure`. Doing so opens a new pop-up window, titled :guilabel:`Quality Check`. Enter the corrected
measurement in the :guilabel:`Measure` field, then click :guilabel:`Validate` to complete the check,
and move on to the next step of the work order.

If the measurement was entered correctly, click :guilabel:`Confirm Measure` instead, and the quality
check fails. Follow any instructions that were listed on the :guilabel:`Quality Check Failed` pop-up
window.

If a quality alert must be created, do so by clicking the :guilabel:`â˜° (three horizontal lines)`
button, and selecting :guilabel:`Quality Alert` from the :guilabel:`Menu` pop-up window. A
:guilabel:`Quality Alerts` pop-up window appears, from which a quality alert can be created.

For a complete guide on how to fill out the quality alert form, view the documentation on
:ref:`quality alerts <quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`.
