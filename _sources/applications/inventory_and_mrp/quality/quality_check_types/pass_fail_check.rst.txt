In Odoo *Quality*, a *Pass - Fail* check is one of the quality check types that can be selected when
creating a new quality check or quality control point (QCP). *Pass - Fail* checks consist of a text
field that allows the creator to specify a certain criteria that a product must meet to pass the
check.

Create a Pass - Fail quality check
==================================

There are two distinct ways that *Pass - Fail* quality checks can be created. A single check can be
manually created. Alternatively, a |QCP| can be configured that automatically creates checks at a
predetermined interval.

This documentation only details the configuration options that are unique to *Pass - Fail* quality
checks and |QCPs|. For a full overview of all the configuration options available when creating a
single check or a |QCP|, see the documentation on :ref:`quality checks
<quality/quality_management/quality-checks>` and :ref:`quality control points
<quality/quality_management/quality-control-points>`.

Quality check
-------------

To create a single *Pass - Fail* quality check, navigate to :menuselection:`Quality --> Quality
Control --> Quality Checks`, and click :guilabel:`New`. Fill out the new quality check form as
follows:

- In the :guilabel:`Type` drop-down field, select the :guilabel:`Pass - Fail` quality check type.
- In the :guilabel:`Team` drop-down field, select the quality team responsible for managing the
  check.
- In the :guilabel:`Instructions` text field of the :guilabel:`Notes` tab, enter instructions for
  how to complete the quality check and the criteria that must be met for the check to pass.

Quality Control Point (QCP)
---------------------------

To create a |QCP| that generates *Pass - Fail* quality checks automatically, begin by navigating to
:menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Control Points`, and click :guilabel:`New`. Fill out
the new |QCP| form as follows:

- In the :guilabel:`Type` drop-down field, select the :guilabel:`Pass - Fail` quality check type.
- In the :guilabel:`Team` drop-down field, select the quality team responsible for managing the
  checks created by the |QCP|.
- In the :guilabel:`Instructions` text field, enter instructions for how to complete the quality
  check and the criteria that must be met for the check to pass.

Process a Pass - Fail quality check
===================================

Once created, there are multiple ways that *Measure* quality checks can be processed. If a quality
check is assigned to a specific inventory, manufacturing, or work order, the check can be processed
on the order itself. Alternatively, a check can be processed from the check's page.

From the check's page
---------------------

To process a *Measure* quality check from the check's page, begin by navigating to
:menuselection:`Quality --> Quality Control --> Quality Checks`, and select a quality check. Follow
the :guilabel:`Instructions` for how to complete the check.

If the criteria for the check is met, click the :guilabel:`Pass` button at the top-left corner of
the page. If the criteria is not met, click the :guilabel:`Fail` button.

On an order
-----------

To process a *Pass - Fail* quality check on an order, select a manufacturing order or inventory
order (receipt, delivery, return, etc.), for which a check is required. Manufacturing orders can be
selected by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing Orders`,
and clicking on an order. Inventory orders can be selected by navigating to
:menuselection:`Inventory`, clicking the :guilabel:`# To Process` button on an operation card, and
selecting an order.

On the selected manufacturing or inventory order, a purple :guilabel:`Quality Checks` button appears
at the top of the order. Click the button to open the :guilabel:`Quality Check` pop-up window, which
shows all of the quality checks required for that order.

To process a *Pass - Fail* quality check, follow the instructions shown on the :guilabel:`Quality
Check` pop-up window. If the criteria for the check is met, click the :guilabel:`Pass` button at the
bottom of the window. If the criteria is not met, click the :guilabel:`Fail` button.

If a quality alert must be created, click the :guilabel:`Quality Alert` button that appears at the
top of the manufacturing or inventory order after the check fails. Clicking :guilabel:`Quality
Alert` opens a quality alert form on a new page. For a complete guide on how to fill out quality
alert forms, view the documentation on :ref:`quality alerts
<quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`.

On a work order
---------------

When configuring a |QCP| that is triggered during manufacturing, a specific work order can also be
specified in the :guilabel:`Work Order Operation` field on the |QCP| form. If a work order is
specified, a *Pass - Fail* quality check is created for that specific work order, rather than the
manufacturing order as a whole.

*Pass - Fail* quality checks configured for work orders must be processed from the tablet view. To
do so, begin by navigating to :menuselection:`Manufacturing --> Operations --> Manufacturing
Orders`. Select a manufacturing order that includes a work order for which a quality check is
required. Open the tablet view for that work order by selecting the :guilabel:`Work Orders` tab, and
then clicking the :guilabel:`ðŸ“± (tablet)` button on the order's line.

With tablet view open, complete the steps listed on the left side of the screen until the *Pass -
Fail* quality check step is reached. Upon reaching the check, follow the instructions that appear at
the top of the screen. If the criteria for the check is met, click the :guilabel:`Pass` button at
the top-right of the screen. If the criteria is not met, click the :guilabel:`Fail` button.

If a quality alert must be created, do so by clicking the :guilabel:`â˜° (menu)` button in the tablet
view, and selecting :guilabel:`Quality Alert` from the :guilabel:`Menu` pop-up window. A
:guilabel:`Quality Alerts` pop-up window appears, from which a quality alert can be created. For a
complete guide on how to fill out quality alert forms, view the documentation on :ref:`quality
alerts <quality/quality_management/quality-alerts>`.
