===============================
Select a replenishment strategy
===============================

In Odoo, there are two strategies for replenishing inventory: **Reordering Rules** and the **Make
to Order (MTO)** route. Although these strategies differ slightly, they both have similar
consequences: triggering the automatic creation of a purchase or manufacturing order. The choice of
which strategy to use depends on the business's manufacturing and delivery processes.

Terminology
===========

Replenishment report and reordering rules
-----------------------------------------

The replenishment report is a list of all products that have a negative forecast quantity.

Reordering rules are used to ensure that there's always a minimum amount of a product in stock in
order to manufacture products and/or fulfill sales orders. When the stock level of a product
reaches its minimum, Odoo automatically generates a purchase order with the quantity needed to
reach the maximum stock level.

Reordering rules can be created and managed in the replenishment report or from the product form.

Make to Order
-------------

Make to Order (MTO) is a procurement route that creates a draft purchase order or manufacturing
order each time a sales order is confirmed, *regardless of the current stock level*.

Unlike products replenished using reordering rules, Odoo automatically links the sales order to the
purchase order (PO) or manufacturing order (MO) generated by the MTO route. Another difference
between reordering rules and MTO is with MTO, Odoo generates a draft :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)` or
:abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)` immediately after the sales order is confirmed. With reordering
rules, Odoo generates a draft :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)` or :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)` when
the product's forecasted stock falls below the set minimum quantity. In addition, Odoo will
automatically add quantities to the :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)`/:abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)` as
the forecast changes, as long as the :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)`/:abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)`
is not confirmed.

The MTO route is the best replenishment strategy for products that are customized and should be
used for this purpose only.

Configuration
=============

Replenishment report and reordering rules
-----------------------------------------

To access the replenishment report, go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Operations -->
Replenishment`. By default, the replenishment report shows every product that needs to be manually
reordered. If there is no specific rule for a product, Odoo assumes that the :guilabel:`Minimum
Quantity` and :guilabel:`Maximum Quantity` stock are both `0.00`.

.. note::
   For products that don't have a set reordering rule, Odoo calculates the forecast as sales orders,
   deliveries, and receipts are confirmed. For products that have a set reordering rule, Odoo
   calculates the forecast normally, but also takes into account the purchase/manufacturing lead
   time and security lead time.

Before creating a new reordering rule, make sure the product has a vendor or a bill of materials
configured on the product form. Also, make sure the :guilabel:`Product Type` is set to `Storable
Product` on the product form. By definition, a consumable product does not have its inventory
levels tracked, so Odoo can not account for a consumable product in the stock valuation.

To create a new reordering rule from the replenishment report, go to :menuselection:`Inventory -->
Operations --> Replenishment`, click :guilabel:`Create`, and set the :guilabel:`Product`. If
desired, set a :guilabel:`Min Quantity` and a :guilabel:`Max Quantity`. Finally, click
:guilabel:`Save`.

To create a new reordering rule from the product form, go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Products
--> Products`, select a product to open its product form, click the :guilabel:`Reordering Rules`
smart button, and click :guilabel:`Create`. Then, fill out the fields and save the new reordering
rule.

By default, the quantity in the :guilabel:`To Order` field is the quantity required to reach the
set :guilabel:`Max Quantity`. However, the :guilabel:`To Order` quantity can be adjusted by
clicking on the field, changing the value, and clicking :guilabel:`Save`. To replenish a product
manually, click :guilabel:`Order Once`.

To automate replenishment, click :guilabel:`Automate Orders`. When this button is clicked, Odoo
will automatically generate a draft :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)`/:abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)`
every time the forecasted stock level falls below the set :guilabel:`Min Quantity` of the
reordering rule.


A reordering rule can be temporarily deactivated for a given period by using the :guilabel:`Snooze`
button.

A :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)` or :abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)` created by a manual replenishment
will have `Replenishment Report` as the source document. A :abbr:`PO (Purchase Order)` or
:abbr:`MO (Manufacturing Order)` created by an automated reordering rule will have the sales
order(s) reference number(s) that triggered the rule as the source document.

Make to order
-------------

Since the Make to Order (MTO) route is only recommended for customized products, the route is
hidden by default.

To activate the Make to Order (MTO) route in Odoo:

#. Go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings --> Warehouse`.
#. Activate :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` setting and click :guilabel:`Save`.
#. Go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Configuration --> Routes`.
#. Click on :menuselection:`Filters --> Archived` to show archived routes.
#. Select the checkbox next to :guilabel:`Replenish on Order (MTO)`, and click on
   :menuselection:`Action --> Unarchive`.

.. note::
   Activating the :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` setting also activates :guilabel:`Storage Locations`
   setting. If these features aren't applicable to the warehouse, disable these settings after
   unarchiving the MTO route.

To set a product's procurement route to MTO, go to :menuselection:`Inventory --> Products -->
Products`, click on a product to open the product form, and click :guilabel:`Edit`. Then, click on
the :guilabel:`Inventory` tab and in the :guilabel:`Routes` options, select :guilabel:`Replenish on
Order (MTO)`. For products purchased directly from a vendor, make sure the :guilabel:`Buy` route is
selected in addition to the MTO route and a vendor is configured in the :guilabel:`Purchase` tab.
For products manufactured in-house, make sure the :guilabel:`Manufacture` route is selected in
addition to the MTO route and a bill of materials is configured for the product. Finally, click
:guilabel:`Save`.
