         click :guilabel:`Connect Stripe`.
      #. Go through the setup process and confirm your email address when Stripe sends you a
         confirmation email.
      #. At the end of the process, click :guilabel:`Agree and submit`. If all requested information
         has been submitted, you are then redirected to Odoo, and your payment provider is enabled.

     :ref:`navigate to the payment provider Stripe <payment_providers/supported_providers>`,
     :ref:`fill in your API credentials <stripe/api_keys>` with the test keys, and set the
