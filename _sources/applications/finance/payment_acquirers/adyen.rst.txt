Odoo needs your **API Credentials** to connect with your Adyen account, which comprise:

- **Merchant Account**: The code of the merchant account to use with Adyen.
- :ref:`API Key <adyen/api_and_client_keys>`: The API key of the webservice user.
- :ref:`Client Key <adyen/api_and_client_keys>`: The client key of the webservice user.
- :ref:`HMAC Key <adyen/hmac_key>`: The HMAC key of the webhook.
- :ref:`Checkout API URL <adyen/urls>`: The base URL for the Checkout API endpoints.
- :ref:`Recurring API URL <adyen/urls>`: The base URL for the Recurring API endpoints.

You can copy your credentials from your Adyen account, and paste them in the related fields under
the **Credentials** tab.

.. important::
   If you are trying Adyen as a test, with an Adyen *test account*, head to
   :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Payment Acquirers`. There, click on
   :guilabel:`Adyen`, enable :guilabel:`Test Mode` and enter your credentials in the
   :guilabel:`Credentials` tab.

API Key and Client Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to retrieve the API Key and the Client Key, log into your Adyen account, go to
:menuselection:`Developers --> API Credentials`.
- If you already have an API user, open it.
- If you don't have an API user yet, click on **Create new credential**.
Go to :menuselection:`Server settings --> Authentification` and copy or generate your **API Key**.
Be careful to copy your API key as you'll not be allowed to get it later without generating a new
one.

Now, head to :menuselection:`Client settings --> Authentification` and cody or generate your
**Client Key**. This is also the place where you can :ref:`allow payments to be made from your
website <adyen/allowed_origins>`.

.. _adyen/hmac_key:

HMAC key
~~~~~~~~

In order to retrieve the HMAC Key, you'll need to configure a `Standard Notification` webhook. For
this, log into your Adyen account then go to :menuselection:`Developers --> Webhooks --> Add webhook
