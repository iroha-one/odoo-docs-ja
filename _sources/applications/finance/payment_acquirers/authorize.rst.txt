Authorize.Net

provider, allowing businesses to accept **credit cards**.

Configuration

Credentials tab
---------------

Odoo needs your **API Credentials & Keys** to connect with your Authorize.Net account, which
comprise:

- **API Login ID**: The ID solely used to identify the account with Authorize.Net.
- **API Transaction Key**
- **API Signature Key**
- **API Client Key**

To retrieve them, log into your Authorize.Net account, go to :menuselection:`Account --> Settings
--> Security Settings --> API Credentials & Keys`, generate your **Transaction Key** and
**Signature Key**, and paste them on the related fields in Odoo. Then, click on **Generate Client
Key**.

.. important::
   If you are trying Authorize.Net as a test, with a *sandbox account*, change the :guilabel:`State`
   to :guilabel:`Test Mode`. We recommend doing this on a test Odoo database, rather than on your
   main database.

   If you set :guilabel:`Test Mode` on Odoo and use an authorize.net account instead of a
   sandbox.authorize.net account, it results in the following error: *The merchant login ID or
   password is invalid or the account is inactive*.

Configuration tab
-----------------

Place a hold on a card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With Authorize.net, you can enable the :ref:`manual capture
<payment_acquirers/features/manual_capture>`. If enabled, the funds are reserved for 30 days on the
customer's card, but not charged yet.

.. warning::
   After **30 days**, the transaction is **voided automatically** by Authorize.net.
