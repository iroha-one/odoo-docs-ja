Odoo electronic invoicing in France
===================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to France's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in France
=========================================

In France, electronic invoicing is regulated by the `Ordonnance n° 2019-359
<https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000038410002>`_, which is aligned with `EU Directive
2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_, and requires
mandatory :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` e-invoicing through the Chorus Pro platform. Starting
in 2024, B2B e-invoicing will be progressively implemented, becoming mandatory for all businesses by
2026. This reform aims to combat tax fraud, improve VAT collection, and enhance business
transparency. The Factur-X hybrid format (a combination of PDF and XML data) is widely used in
France, ensuring compliance with both local and European e-invoicing standards.

Compliance with French e-invoicing regulations
==============================================

Odoo Invoicing makes it easy for businesses to send, store, and ensure the integrity of their
invoices. Here is how Odoo ensures compliance:

- **Supported formats**: Odoo supports the Factur-X hybrid format (PDF with embedded XML) required
  for compliance with French e-invoicing standards. It is also compatible with :abbr:`UBL (Universal
  Business Language)` XML for transactions via the Peppol network, facilitating both local and
  international invoicing. Odoo enables businesses, through Chorus Pro France’s official e-invoicing
  platform, to submit compliant e-invoices directly to public authorities and soon to private sector
  recipients as B2B e-invoicing becomes mandatory.
- **Secure storage and retrieval**: In compliance with French regulations, which require invoices to
  be stored for a minimum of 10 years, Odoo securely archives all invoices in a tamper-proof system,
  ensuring easy access for audits and inspections.
- **Automatic VAT calculation and reporting**: Odoo Invoicing automates VAT calculations, ensuring
  invoices meet French VAT requirements and are formatted correctly for both B2G and B2B
  transactions, supporting seamless compliance with evolving standards.
