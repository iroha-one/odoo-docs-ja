====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Ireland's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Ireland
==========================================

In Ireland, businesses must comply with e-invoicing regulations to ensure secure, authentic, and
storable transactions. The legal framework for e-invoicing is primarily shaped by `EU Directive
2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_, which
mandates the use of electronic invoicing in :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions. Irish
public sector bodies must accept electronic invoices that comply with the European Standard EN
16931. E-invoicing in the public sector is facilitated through the Peppol network, providing a
streamlined and standardized platform for invoicing. While not mandatory for B2B transactions,
e-invoicing is increasingly encouraged to enhance efficiency, transparency, and compliance.

Compliance with Irish e-invoicing regulations
=============================================

Odoo Invoicing is equipped to meet Ireland's e-invoicing requirements, ensuring businesses
can operate with confidence. Here is how Odoo ensures compliance:

  Peppol network, enabling businesses to send compliant e-invoices directly to Irish public sector

  system, ensuring they can be easily accessed during audits or inspections.

  regulations by automatically calculating and including VAT in invoices, while formatting them to
