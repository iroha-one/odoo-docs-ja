Odoo electronic invoicing in Portugal
=====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Portugal's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Portugal
===========================================

In Portugal, e-invoicing is regulated under the Portuguese VAT Code and in compliance with `EU
Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_ for
:abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions. E-invoicing has been mandatory for public sector
suppliers since 2021. Businesses must use structured e-invoices in the :abbr:`CIUS-PT (Customizable
Invoice User Specification for Portugal)` format, which aligns with European standards. While B2B
e-invoicing is not yet mandatory, its adoption is encouraged to improve tax compliance and
efficiency. Additionally, e-invoices must be validated and certified under Portugal's SAF-T (PT)
system, which integrates with the tax authority for reporting.
