Odoo electronic invoicing in the Basque Country
===============================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to meet Basque Country's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in the Basque Country
=====================================================

In the Basque Country, electronic invoicing is governed by Spanish national legislation and regional
implementations, including the `Ley de Facturaci贸n Electr贸nica <https://www.facturae.gob.es/face/Paginas/FACE.aspx>`_
and compliance with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_.
For :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions, e-invoicing is mandatory, and suppliers must
submit e-invoices through the FACe platform or the regional system, e-Factura Euskadi, specifically
designed for the Basque Country. These platforms ensure the secure submission of invoices to public
administrations. While B2B e-invoicing is not yet mandatory, its use is growing, supported by the
implementation of the TicketBAI system, which is specific to the Basque Country and promotes tax
transparency.
