Odoo electronic invoicing in Hungary
====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Hungary's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Hungary
==========================================

In Hungary, businesses must adhere to e-invoicing regulations to ensure secure, authentic, and
storable transactions. The primary legal framework is the Hungarian VAT Act (Act CXXVII of 2007),
which mandates real-time reporting of invoices to the NAV Online invoice system, Hungary's
government e-invoicing platform. As of 2021, all B2B and B2C invoices must be reported in real-time,
regardless of value. Hungary's regulations do not currently require :abbr:`B2G
(business-to-government)` e-invoicing, but public sector invoicing is encouraged via the Peppol
network. Common formats for e-invoicing include XML for NAV submissions and other structured formats
to streamline compliance.

Compliance with Hungarian e-invoicing regulations
