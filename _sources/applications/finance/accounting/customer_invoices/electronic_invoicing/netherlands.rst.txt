Odoo electronic invoicing in the Netherlands
============================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to the Netherlands' regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in the Netherlands
==================================================

In the Netherlands, e-invoicing is regulated under `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_,
requiring :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions to adhere to the European Standard EN
16931. Public sector entities must accept e-invoices through platforms such as Digipoort, the Dutch
government's official gateway for electronic data exchange. The Netherlands is also a prominent
member of the Peppol network, which enables secure and standardized e-invoicing for cross-border
transactions across Europe. While e-invoicing is not yet mandatory for B2B transactions, it is
strongly encouraged to enhance transparency and efficiency in business processes.

Compliance with Dutch e-invoicing regulations
=============================================

Odoo invoicing is equipped to support businesses with the Netherlands' e-invoicing requirements.
Here is how Odoo ensures compliance:

- **Supported formats**: Odoo supports :abbr:`UBL (Universal Business Language)` XML, which is the
  standard format for e-invoicing in the Netherlands. It ensures compatibility with both Digipoort
  for domestic B2G transactions and the Peppol network for international e-invoicing.
- **Secure storage and retrieval**: In accordance with Dutch regulations, which require businesses
  to store invoices for a minimum of seven years, Odoo securely archives all invoices in a
  tamper-proof system, ensuring they are accessible during audits or inspections.
- **Automatic VAT calculation and reporting**: Odoo Invoicing automates VAT calculations and formats
  invoices to meet Dutch VAT requirements, ensuring compliance with legal standards for both
  :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` and B2B transactions.
