Odoo electronic invoicing in Romania
====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Romania's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Romania
==========================================

In Romania, e-invoicing is regulated under the `Fiscal Code <http://www.dreptonline.ro/carti/start_carte.php?id_carte=324>`_
and aligned with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_,
which mandates e-invoicing for :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions. Romania has
implemented the RO e-Factura system, the national platform for issuing and receiving electronic
invoices in a standardized format. The use of RO e-Factura is mandatory for :abbr:`B2G
(business-to-government)` transactions and for specific high-risk B2B sectors, with further
expansion anticipated. Romania is also integrated with the Peppol network, facilitating cross-border
e-invoicing and compliance within the European Union.

Compliance with Romanian e-invoicing regulations
================================================

Odoo invoicing module is fully equipped to help businesses comply with Romania’s specific
e-invoicing requirements. Here’s how Odoo supports compliance:

- **Supported formats**: Odoo supports XML in :abbr:`UBL (Universal Business Language)` and the
  structured formats required by RO e-Factura, ensuring compliance with Romania's e-invoicing
  standards for B2G and high-risk B2B transactions. Additionally, Odoo supports formats compatible
  with the Peppol network, enabling seamless cross-border invoicing. Odoo integrates with the RO
  e-Factura system, allowing businesses to generate, validate, and submit e-invoices directly to
  Romanian public authorities or private entities as required by law. Odoo helps businesses comply
  with eTransport requirements by generating and managing the data necessary for reporting the
  movement of high-fiscal risk goods. This includes shipment details such as the nature of the
  goods, vehicle information, and delivery destinations, ensuring timely submission to the
  :abbr:`ANAF (Romanian National Agency for Fiscal Administration)`.
- **Secure storage and retrieval**: In compliance with Romanian regulations, which require invoices
  to be stored for a minimum of ten years, Odoo securely archives all invoices in a tamper-proof
  system, ensuring accessibility during audits or inspections.
- **Automatic VAT calculation and reporting**: Odoo Invoicing automates VAT calculations and formats
  invoices to comply with Romanian VAT requirements, ensuring accuracy and adherence to legal
  standards for both :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` and B2B transactions.
