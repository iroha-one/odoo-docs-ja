==================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Italy's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Italy
========================================

Italy has one of the most advanced e-invoicing frameworks in Europe, governed by the `Italian budget
law <https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2022/12/29/22G00211/sg>`_ and regulations issued by the
Agenzia delle Entrate. Since 2019, e-invoicing is mandatory for B2B, B2C, and :abbr:`B2G
(business-to-government)` transactions. All e-invoices must be submitted through the :abbr:`Sdi
(Sistema di Interscambio)`, the Italian government's centralized exchange system. The format for
e-invoices is FatturaPA, a structured XML format specifically designed for compliance with Italian
regulations. As part of its compliance with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_,
Italy also supports Peppol standards for cross-border e-invoicing.
