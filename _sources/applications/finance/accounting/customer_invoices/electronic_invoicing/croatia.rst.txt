====================================

Odoo Invoicing is our trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Croatia's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Croatia
==========================================

In Croatia, businesses must comply with e-invoicing regulations to ensure secure, authentic, and
storable transactions. The main legal framework governing e-invoicing in Croatia is the
Fiscalization Act and its related requirements for public procurement, which are aligned with `EU
Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_ on
e-invoicing in public procurement. Under these regulations, all businesses involved in :abbr:`B2G
(business-to-government)` transactions are required to use electronic invoicing via the :abbr:`CIS
(Central Invoice System)`, Croatia’s official platform for public sector e-invoicing. Croatia is
also part of the Peppol network, facilitating standardized cross-border e-invoicing within the
European Union. Furthermore, e-invoicing is increasingly encouraged for B2B transactions, promoting
greater transparency and tax compliance.
