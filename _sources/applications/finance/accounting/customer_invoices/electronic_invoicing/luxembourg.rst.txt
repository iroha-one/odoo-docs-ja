Odoo electronic invoicing in Luxembourg
=======================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Luxembourg's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Luxembourg
=============================================

In Luxembourg, e-invoicing is regulated in accordance with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_,
requiring the use of electronic invoicing in :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions.
Public sector entities in Luxembourg must accept e-invoices in the European Standard EN 16931
format. The government supports e-invoicing through the Peppol network, ensuring streamlined
communication and compliance for cross-border transactions. While e-invoicing is not yet mandatory
for B2B transactions, its adoption is encouraged to promote operational efficiency and tax
compliance across industries.
