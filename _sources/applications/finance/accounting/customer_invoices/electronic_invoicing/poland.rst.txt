Odoo electronic invoicing in Poland
===================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Poland's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Poland
=========================================

In Poland, e-invoicing is governed by the `Polish VAT Act <https://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20230001598>`_
and the National e-Invoicing System (KSeF â€“ Krajowy System e-Faktur), which became operational in
2022. While :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` e-invoicing is mandatory under `EU Directive
2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_, B2B
e-invoicing is mandatory for all businesses starting July 2024, following Poland's adoption of the
e-invoicing scheme. E-invoices must be issued in the FA_VAT (structured XML) format and transmitted
through the KSeF platform, ensuring compliance with tax reporting and transparency goals.
