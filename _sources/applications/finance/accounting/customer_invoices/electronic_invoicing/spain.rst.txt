Odoo electronic invoicing in Spain
==================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Spain's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Spain
========================================

In Spain, e-invoicing is governed by the `Ley de Facturación Electrónica <https://www.facturae.gob.es/face/Paginas/FACE.aspx>`_
and aligned with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_,
mandating e-invoicing for :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions. All invoices to public
sector entities must be submitted through the FACe platform, Spain’s official electronic invoicing
hub, using the required Facturae format. Additionally, the :abbr:`SII (Immediate Supply of
Information)` system mandates near real-time reporting of VAT-related invoice data for certain
companies, reinforcing transparency and compliance. While e-invoicing is not yet mandatory for B2B
transactions, its adoption is expected to expand in the near future.

Compliance with Spanish e-invoicing regulations
===============================================

Odoo Invoicing is fully equipped to help businesses meet Spain's e-invoicing and VAT reporting
requirements. Here is how Odoo ensures compliance:

- **Supported formats**: Odoo supports the Facturae (XML) format required by the FACe platform for
  public sector e-invoicing in Spain. It is also compatible with XML in :abbr:`UBL (Universal
  Business Language)` formats used within the Peppol network for cross-border transactions. Odoo
  integrates with FACe, allowing businesses to submit e-invoices directly to Spanish public
  authorities. Odoo also facilitates compliance with the SII system, enabling automated and near
  real-time reporting of VAT-related data to the Spanish Tax Agency.
- **Secure storage and retrieval**: In compliance with Spanish regulations requiring invoices to be
  stored for a minimum of four years, Odoo securely archives all invoices in a tamper-proof system,
  ensuring easy access during audits or inspections.
- **Automatic VAT calculation and reporting**: Odoo Invoicing automates VAT calculations and ensures
  invoices are formatted to meet Spanish requirements for both :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)`
  and B2B transactions, helping businesses comply with national and EU standards.
