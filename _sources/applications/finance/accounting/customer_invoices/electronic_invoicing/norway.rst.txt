Odoo electronic invoicing in Norway
===================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Norway's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Norway
=========================================

In Norway, e-invoicing is governed by regulations aligned with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_,
requiring :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions to comply with mandatory e-invoicing
standards. Norwegian public sector entities mandate the use of the EHF (Elektronisk Handelsformat)
standard for e-invoices, ensuring uniformity and security. Norway is a member of the Peppol network,
which supports standardized and interoperable cross-border e-invoicing throughout Europe. Although
not mandatory for B2B transactions, e-invoicing is widely encouraged and adopted across the private
sector to boost efficiency, transparency, and compliance.
