Odoo electronic invoicing in Belgium
====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Belgium's regulatory standards, and compatible with the European `Peppol
<https://peppol.org/about/>`_ framework.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Belgium
==========================================

In Belgium, businesses must adhere to e-invoicing laws that ensure secure, authentic, and storable
transactions. The primary regulation governing e-invoicing requirements in Belgium is the `Belgian
VAT Code <https://finances.belgium.be/fr/sur_le_spf/r%C3%A9glementation/r%C3%A9glementation-2023/tva>`_
and its related `e-invoicing standards for public procurement <https://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/article.pl?language=fr&sum_date=&pd_search=2023-09-21&numac_search=2023045155&page=1&lg_txt=F&caller=list&2023045155=0&trier=promulgation&fr=f&nm_ecran=2023045155&choix1=et&choix2=et>`_,
which align with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_.
These laws mandate that all businesses engaged in :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions
must use e-invoicing via Mercurius, Belgium's official electronic invoicing platform for public
procurement transactions. Additionally, Belgium is part of the Peppol network, which provides a
standardized framework for cross-border e-invoicing across Europe. Increasingly, e-invoicing is also
encouraged for B2B transactions to enhance tax compliance and transparency.
