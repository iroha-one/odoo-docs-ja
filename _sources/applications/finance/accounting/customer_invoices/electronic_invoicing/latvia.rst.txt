===================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Latvia's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Latvia
=========================================

In Latvia, electronic invoicing is governed by the `Law on Accounting <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/LV/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:72014L0055LVA_270633>`_
and regulations aligned with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_,
mandating the use of e-invoicing in :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions. All public
sector invoices must be sent in the European Standard EN 16931 format through platforms such as
eInvoicing.lv, Latviaâ€™s official e-invoicing infrastructure. Latvia is also connected to the Peppol
network, facilitating standardized cross-border e-invoicing across the European Union.
