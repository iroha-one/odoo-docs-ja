====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Estonia's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Estonia
==========================================

In Estonia, businesses must comply with e-invoicing regulations to ensure secure, authentic, and
storable transactions. The main legal framework governing e-invoicing in Estonia is the `Accounting
Act <https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/514052021001/consolide/current>`_ and its provisions
related to e-invoicing, which align with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_
on e-invoicing in public procurement. Since 2019, :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions
must use electronic invoices via Estonia's Rik's e-Invoicing System, the government's platform for
public sector e-invoicing. Estonia is also part of the Peppol network, which ensures standardized
cross-border e-invoicing across Europe. Additionally, the use of e-invoicing is encouraged for B2B
transactions, promoting better transparency, efficiency, and compliance with VAT requirements.
