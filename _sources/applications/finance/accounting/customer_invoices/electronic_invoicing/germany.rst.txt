Odoo electronic invoicing in Germany
====================================

Odoo Invoicing is your trusted partner for safe, efficient, and legally compliant e-invoicing
solutions tailored to Germany's regulatory standards.

Legal framework for e-invoicing in Germany
==========================================

In Germany, e-invoicing is governed by the `E-Rechnungsgesetz <https://www.bgbl.de/xaver/bgbl/start.xav?start=%2F%2F*%5B%40attr_id%3D%27bgbl117s0770.pdf%27%5D#__bgbl__%2F%2F*%5B%40attr_id%3D%27bgbl117s0770.pdf%27%5D__1733401471138>`_,
which is aligned with `EU Directive 2014/55/EU <https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32014L0055>`_,
requiring e-invoicing for all :abbr:`B2G (business-to-government)` transactions. Invoices to public
sector entities must comply with the XRechnung format or the Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 standard.
Submission is typically handled through platforms like :abbr:`ZRE (Zentraler Rechnungseingang)` or
:abbr:`OZG-RE (Onlinezugangsgesetz-Rechnungseingang)`. While B2B e-invoicing is not yet mandatory,
its adoption is increasing as businesses seek to enhance compliance, efficiency, and transparency.
