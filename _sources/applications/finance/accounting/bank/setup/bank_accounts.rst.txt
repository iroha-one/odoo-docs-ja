Bank and cash accounts
======================

You can manage as many bank or cash accounts as needed on your database. Configuring them well
allows you to have all your banking data up-to-date and ready for :doc:`reconciliation
<../../bank/reconciliation/use_cases>` with your journal entries.

In Odoo Accounting, each bank account has a dedicated journal set to post all entries in a dedicated
account. Both the journal and the account are automatically created and configured whenever you add
a bank account.

.. note::
   Cash journals and accounts must be configured manually.

Bank journals are displayed by default on the :guilabel:`Accounting Dashboard` in the form of cards
which include action buttons.

Manage your bank and cash accounts
==================================

Connect your bank for automatic synchronization
-----------------------------------------------

To connect your bank account to your database, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration
--> Banks: Add a Bank Account`, select your bank in the list, click on :guilabel:`Connect`, and
follow the instructions.

Create a bank account
---------------------

If your banking institution is not available in Odoo, or if you don't want to connect your bank
account to your database, you can configure your bank account manually.

To manually add a bank account, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Banks:
Add a Bank Account`, click on :guilabel:`Create it` (at the bottom right), and fill out the form.

.. note::
   - Odoo automatically detects the bank account type (e.g., IBAN) and enables some features
     accordingly.
   - A default bank journal is available and can be used to configure your bank account by going to
     :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Journals --> Bank`. Open it and
     edit the different fields to match your bank account information.

Create a cash journal
---------------------

To create a new cash journal, go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting:
Journals`, click on :guilabel:`Create` and select :guilabel:`Cash` in the :guilabel:`Type` field.

For more information on the accounting information fields, read the
:ref:`bank_accounts/configuration` section of this page.

.. note::
   A default cash journal is available and can be used straight away. You can review it by going to
   :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Accounting: Journals --> Cash`.

Edit an existing bank or cash journal

The :guilabel:`Profit Account` is used to register a profit when the ending balance of a cash
register differs from what the system computes, while the :guilabel:`Loss Account` is used to
register a loss when the ending balance of a cash register differs from what the system computes.

Currency

You can edit the currency used to enter the statements.

Bank feeds
----------

:guilabel:`Bank Feeds` defines how the bank statements are registered. Three options are available:

- :guilabel:`Undefined yet`, which should be selected when you donâ€™t know yet if you will
  synchronize your bank account with your database or not.
- :guilabel:`Import (CAMT, CODA, CSV, OFX, QIF)`, which should be selected if you want to import
  your bank statement using a different format.
- :guilabel:`Automated Bank Synchronization`, which should be selected if your bank is synchronized
  with your database.
