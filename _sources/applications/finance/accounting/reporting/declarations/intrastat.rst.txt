Intrastat
=========

**Intrastat** is the system for data collection and statistic production of goods traded among the
EU Member States. Organizations whose annual trade surpasses a certain threshold must provide data
about the goods traded with other EU countries.

.. note::
   As of January 1, 2022, the reporting requirements have changed. One main modification concerns
   the transaction codes which are now switching to a 2-digits format. All transactions recorded
   after this date have to follow the new systemâ€™s rules.

Configuration
=============

Go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Settings --> Customer Invoices`, then enable **Intrastat** and
*Save*. Once the Intrastat has been activated you are able to choose the **Default incoterm**.

.. important::
   If you created your Odoo database prior to **January 13, 2022**, please :ref:`upgrade
   <general/upgrade>` the ``account_intrastat`` module to add the new transaction codes and
   :ref:`install <general/install>` the ``account_intrastat_expiry`` module to archive the old
   codes.
